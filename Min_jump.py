''' Array of n integers where each element represents the maximum length of the jump that can be made forward from that element. 
    This means if array[i] is equal to x, then we can jump any distance y, such that y less than or equal to x. 
    Find the minimum no. of jumps to reach the end of the array starting from the first element. 
    If an element is zero, then you can't move to the next element'''
